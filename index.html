        <p>I am currently pursuing a major in music with an emphasis in vocal performance. I hope to go into composition in the future! Although my voice is my favorite instrument, I've also played flute for over six years and I am learning guitar and ukulele. I also love to play the piano. </p>
        <p>I am taking WDD130 because it will be useful for any future careers I may have.</p>
